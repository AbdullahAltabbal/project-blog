abstract: One of the most commonly-misunderstood operators is Modulo (%). In this tutorial, we'll unpack exactly what this little bugger does, and learn how it can help us solve practical problems.

When I was first learning to code, I remember finding the Modulo operator (%) _extremely_ confusing. ðŸ˜¬

If you don't understand what it's doing, the values it produces seem completely random:

```js
const what = 10 % 4; // 2
const the = 10 % 10; // 0
const heck = 4 % 10; // 4
```

In this blog post, we're going to learn how this operator works by refining our mental model for division. We'll also cover a practical, every-day use case for this curious fella.

## Rethinking division

Suppose we have the following bit of arithmetic:

```
12 Ã· 4
```

Division can often feel pretty abstract, pretty theoretical. But here's a practical way to think about this: we have 12 _items_, and we want to split it into 4 equally sized groups. If we do this, each group will have 3 items:

SVG

Sometimes, though, things aren't evenly divisible. Suppose we had this equation:

```
13 Ã· 4
```

We can still fit 4 items in each group, but we have 1 left over.

**This is known as the _remainder_, and it's what the modulo operator tells us.**

```js
const remainder = 13 % 4;
console.log(remainder); // 1
```

The Modulo operator calculates the amount left over when dividing the left-hand side by the right-hand side.

**Here's the deal:** The Modulo operator is a _remainder_ operator. It `tells us how` many integers are left over after doing the division. For example, suppose we had `10 % 5`. 5 fits into 10 exactly twice, and there's nothing left over, so the remainder is 0.

But what if we try to calculate `10 % 4`? Well, let's see:

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. `It` was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Why do we use it?

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

## Where does it come from?

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
