# Project Blog

The final project from The Joy of React.

# Notes:

- Sandpack should be a stretch goal (with provided solution)
- Parsing frontmatter with Gray Matter (maybe the original MDX shouldn't have any frontmatter? We can provide the markup in the README, and some broad instructions for using gray-matter)
- Substituting `<a>` for Next Link (Early?)
- Tags! Could be a good way to have them implement dynamic route segments, if they haven't already?
- Dark/light toggle? Using cookies and RSC. Sounds tricky, maybe make this the final exercise.
- Deploy! Final exercise
