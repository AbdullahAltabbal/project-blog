# Project Blog

The final project from The Joy of React.

# Notes:

- Sandpack should be a stretch goal (with provided solution)
- Parsing frontmatter with Gray Matter (maybe the original MDX shouldn't have any frontmatter? We can provide the markup in the README, and some broad instructions for using gray-matter)
- Substituting `<a>` for Next Link (Early?)
- Tags! Could be a good way to have them implement dynamic route segments, if they haven't already?
- `loading.js` for improved UX!
- RSS Feed + dark/light buttons: polymorphism review! Create a button that can act as either.
- Dark/light toggle? Using cookies and RSC. Sounds tricky, maybe make this the final exercise.
- Deploy! Final exercise

# Exercise 1: Viewing the blog post

- Give them some instructions around setting up MDX with RSC. Use gray-matter to get frontmatter.
- No `components` yet.
- Tricky business: we need the title in the layout file! Create a helper function, use it in both places. Use `React.cache` to prevent duplicated work.

# Exercise 2: Add `<title>` for the blog post

# Exercise 2: Code snippets with Bright

- Use codehike/bright to render code snippets.
- Explore what we get from MDX, figure out how to create a component that wraps around it.

# Exercise 3: Homepage
